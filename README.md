# Simple Web Page

## Overview
This project consists of a simple web page designed to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interactions. The main functionality includes a dynamic text effect driven by JavaScript to alter the spacing between letters in a header.

## Description
The web page uses basic HTML tags for structure, CSS for basic styling (this might be inline or within `<style>` tags, although not explicitly detailed in the excerpts), and JavaScript for functional interactivity. The page includes a background image, a couple of styled text elements, and an image representing some aspect of the topic (e.g., DevOps Engineering).

## Comments in the Code

### HTML Comments
HTML comments are used to annotate HTML code to help developers understand the structure and purpose of various elements without affecting the rendering of the page. These comments are enclosed in `<!--` and `-->` tags. For example:
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->

### JavaScript Comments
JavaScript comments are used within <script> tags to describe or annotate JavaScript code for clarity. These comments can be either single-line, starting with //, or multi-line, enclosed in /* and */. For example:
// This is a single-line JavaScript comment

/*
This is a
multi-line JavaScript comment
*/
